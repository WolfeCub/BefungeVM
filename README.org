* Befunge VM
  Befunge is a language created by Chris Pressey to be as difficult as possible to compile. It is a 2D reflective programming language.
  While creating a compiler may be intentially complicated a Befunge VM is reasonably simple to implement. This program is a very simple
  implementation. The main difference between this interpreter and standard interpreters is the grid is dynamically allocated rather than
  using a fixed size grid.
